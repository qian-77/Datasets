It is a [WSDM challenge dataset for KKBox's music recommendation](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kkbox-music-recommendation-challenge) in 2018. The dataset is from [KKBox](https://www.kkbox.com), Asia's leading music streaming service, which holds the world's most comprehensive Asia-Pop music library with over 30 million tracks. 

The task is to predict the chances of a user listening to a song repetitively after the first observable listening event within a time window was triggered. If there are recurring listening event(s) triggered within a month after the user's very first observable listening event, its target is marked 1, and 0 otherwise in the training set. KKBox provides a training data set consists of information of the first observable listening event for each unique user-song pair within a specific time duration. Metadata of each unique user and song pair is also provided. The train and the test data are selected from users listening history in a given time period, and are split based on time. Note that only the labeled train set of the dataset is used for benchmarking.
