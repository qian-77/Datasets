## AmazonElectronics_x1

+ Dataset description

  The [Amazon dataset](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) contains product reviews and metadata from Amazon, which is a widely-used benchmark dataset. We reuse the preprocessed dataset from the [DIN work](https://github.com/zhougr1993/DeepInterestNetwork) that is a subset named Electronics. It contains 192,403 users, 63,001 goods, 801 categories and 1,689,188 samples. User behaviors in this dataset are rich, with more than 5 reviews for each user and goods. Features include goods_id, cate_id, user reviewed goods_id_list and cate_id_list. Following DIN, the task is to predict the probability of reviewing the (k+1)-th goods by making use of the first k reviewed goods. The last item of each behavior sequence is reserved for testing.

  The dataset statistics are summarized as follows.
